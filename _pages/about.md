I am a 5th year PhD student at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Wei E. I. Sha (http://www.zjuisee.zju.edu.cn/weisha/). My research interests are in electromagnetic information theory and relevant hardware designs. More specifically, I am interested in electromagnetic analytical and numerical methods that benefit the modeling of wireless communications, as well as exploring novel hardware designs by exploiting the physical insights of communication systems. For new scenarios and applications in 6G communications, the electromagnetic connotations of information are necessary to be made clear, and many research areas should be combined for tackling the new challenges, such as antenna design, channel modeling, circuit design, etc. I have worked on several relevant projects, some of the codes can be found on my GitHub page.
