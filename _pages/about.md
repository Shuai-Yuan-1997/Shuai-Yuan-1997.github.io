I am a 5th year PhD student at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Wei E. I. Sha (http://www.zjuisee.zju.edu.cn/weisha/). My estimated graduation date is Jun 2024.

My research interests are in electromagnetic information theory and relevant wave engineering designs. Specifically, I am interested in the electromagnetic analytical and numerical methods that benefit the modeling of wireless communications. Additionally, I am keen on exploring novel hardware designs by leveraging the physical insights of communication systems. In the context of emerging scenarios and applications in 6G communications, it is essential to clarify the electromagnetic implications of information and model systems from an electromagnetic perspective. Addressing these new challenges often requires combining multiple research areas, including wave physics, antenna design, channel modeling, circuit design, etc. I have worked on several relevant projects, some of the codes can be found on my GitHub page.
